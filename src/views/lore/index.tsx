                <p>Whatever you want to call it, that’s what happened here. Life was pretty great. You know, as great as life can be. It seemed like there was always something going on in the world. Sometimes a war, sometimes a pandemic, but in general, pretty sweet. No-one is quite sure what happened this time around though. Nothing like this has happened before and life will never be the same again.</p>
                <p>The survivors can’t remember much. Just a few small details. Weirdly, they all remember something a little different. It all started with a strange smell in the air in the morning, only this time, it wasn’t the stench of garbage or pollution, this was different. They could taste it. It had putrid, acidic, metallic tones to it. The sort of taste you get when you lick a battery. Sour. It took a couple of hours but eventually the government advised everyone to return to their homes. Some even tried to get a gas mask from the store beforehand, just in case. Only a few managed to get one though.</p>
                <p>Once they had collected children from schools and ransacked the stores for pretty much everything they had in fear of another pandemic, most went home. As per the advice, they locked their doors and windows and were advised to sit tight for the time being. Some even dug out their old face masks and wore them, this was just after a pandemic of course. Hours passed. Nothing happened. Some attempted to go outside, even just into their own backyards. Wasn’t a good idea. As soon as they opened the door the thick smog with a yellow tinge burnt their skin instantly. Must’ve been such a horrible way to go. Bubbling flesh burning through their bones. Poor souls.</p>
                <p>Others demanded answers and attempted to spout their views on social media. No good. Everything was shut down. Their phones were useless. The only thing that they could watch was the news on TV. The advice remained the same.</p>
                <p>This went on for days and weeks. ‘DO NOT LEAVE YOUR HOUSE’.</p>
                <p>After a while, people drove themselves, and their loved ones, insane. They simply couldn’t cope without any form of entertainment. They had grown so accustomed to constant screen-time. No social media, no games, no TV shows. Just news. House by house, they attempted to leave. Burnt. They tried to open windows for some cleaner air. Burnt. All that was left was bones. If we fast forward a few months, it was seriously surprising how many attempted to leave. No-one would’ve predicted how few were left alive.</p>

              <div className="prose prose-lg prose-indigo mt-6 text-white lg:mt-0">
                <p>Then, out of nowhere it seemed, a TV bulletin. The first in weeks that differed from the usual ‘DO NOT LEAVE’ message. It was a man that looked pretty important. ‘IT IS OVER. YOU MAY ALL GO OUTSIDE’ he proclaimed. Nothing more. Of course, many were hesitant. They had seem neighbours try the same just days before and perish before their very eyes.</p>
                <p>But, slowly but surely, people did venture outside. The air was clean. But the world was a very different place. This man called Xavier was all over the news claiming that he was the one that stopped the gas. The same man from before. It’s weird really, everyone is just so used to him being in charge now, its odd to even comprehend anything else. He lives in the building where the news used to be filmed. The same one he did that famous bulletin from. The news station was called ‘The Inside Scoop’. Quite funny really as the only people allowed inside there now are his 63 ‘Soldiers’ that he hand picked from the survivors. He says they are there to help him make humanity thrive again and make it even stronger and prosperous than before. Will be difficult to do with the amount of humans left though.</p>
                <p>Xavier had just one rule. KEEP IN GROUPS OF 5 AT ALL TIMES. This was for their own safety, so he says. Since civilisation collapsed people have been a bit more… brutal. And they only really listen to Xavier and his orders.  Laws aren’t really followed as much either, it’s more like a rule of thumb, not a legality.</p>
                <p>Anyway, apparently he has found this really old massive server that he plans to turn into a huge data storage vault for everyone. He says this way, if another disaster happens all of our memories and files will be safe. The rumour going around at the moment is that only those in groups of 5 get access though. You can bet his soldiers with their gold gas masks get treated well, they always do. Outrageously unfair if you ask me. It is believed that Xavier himself melted down some gold that he found in people’s homes, bank vaults and even some jewels that used to belong to royals in order to make them for his soldiers. He sure thinks a lot of them.</p>
                <p>They had to start from scratch and re-build. And build they did. All under Xavier’s instruction. To be continued… </p>
